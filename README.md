# Minecraft Recode in JavaScript

This project is a sandbox that replicates basic features of **Minecraft**. The primary purpose is to understand the rendering and physics engine of Minecraft. The source code is ported from the **java-minecraft** project.

## 🚀 Features
- **Basic Minecraft mechanics**: Player movement, world generation, and block manipulation.
- **3D world rendering** using **three.js**.
- **Physics engine** for realistic interactions.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Use the **keyboard** for controls (WASD for movement, mouse for looking around).
- Interact with the world by placing and breaking blocks.
- Explore the environment and enjoy basic Minecraft features!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **three.js** (for 3D rendering)
- **long.js** (for 64-bit number handling)
- **aes-js** (for AES encryption)
- **bigint-mod-arith** (BigInt extension for RSA encryption)
- **asn1-parser.js** (for public key parsing)
- **mc-chat-format** (Minecraft chat component parser)
